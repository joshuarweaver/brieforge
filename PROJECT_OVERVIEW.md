# Fieldcraft - Project Overview

**Intelligence-First Campaign Generation System**

## Vision

Transform campaign strategy from guesswork to evidence-based decision-making by mining public intelligence across all major platforms and synthesizing it into actionable, receipted campaign assets.

## Core Differentiators

1. **Receipts Everywhere** - Every strategic decision, hook, and KPI is linked to public signal sources
2. **Omnisearch Intelligence** - Single API (SerpAPI) searches 15+ sources across all platforms
3. **Multi-Agent Review** - 7 specialized AI agents review and improve all outputs
4. **Learning System** - Gets smarter over time from user ratings and patterns
5. **2-Page Strategy** - Dense, actionable strategy (not bloated reports)
6. **Export-First** - No vendor lock-in, everything portable

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Backend**
- Python 3.11+ / FastAPI
- PostgreSQL (multi-tenant)
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- JWT authentication

**LLMs**
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Strategy, analysis, compliance, competitive intel
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Channel optimization, buyer skepticism (cost-effective)

**Intelligence Sources** (via SerpAPI)
- Google SERP (organic + PAA + ads)
- Meta Ad Library (Facebook/Instagram)
- LinkedIn Ads + Organic
- TikTok Ads + Trending
- YouTube (videos + metadata)
- Reddit (research only, not content)
- Pinterest (visual trends)

### Data Flow

  6. Brand Consistency (voice, alignment)
  7. Competitive Intel (differentiation)
    â†“
Apply Diffs (priority: compliance > strategist > others)
    â†“
Final Output:
